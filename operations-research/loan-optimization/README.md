Description
-----------
The project consisted in optimizing loans under various conditions using Integral Linear Programming in OPL-CPLEX.
Simple and compound interests have been considered with various rates, durations. In the last configurations two loans are combined. With eventually a rate changing in increments. The idea is to respect the monthly credit repayment ability of the borrower.

Usage
-----
The scripts can be launched with OPL-CPLEX if the appropriate inital conditions file and the constraints file are both loaded. 

Configurations
----------

- Part 1: Compound interest with various rates and durations

- Part 2: Simple interest with various rates and durations

- Part 3: Combination of two loans: one with compound and one with simple interest

- Part 4: Two loans with incremental compound interests

- Part 5: Same as 4 but with varying monthly credit repayment ability of the borrower over time
