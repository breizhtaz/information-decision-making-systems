Description

US Postal digit classification problem
The idea was to test some machine learning techniques in order to get the best classification scores.
BE_7.R deals with the classification accuracy of the digit 7 and BE_SAD.R with the classification accuracy of all the digits.
uspostal.py is implemented with Sklearn and deals with the same classification problem.

Usage
-----
The scripts can be launched in R/Python if the appropriate data - US Postal dataset - is downloaded.
